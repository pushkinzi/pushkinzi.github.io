            I have been told that I am too young and green to have a wheelhouse. I would naively say however that my primary focuses are in algebraic geometry, vertex operator algebras, and monoidal/tensor categories.

            <ul>
                <li>I recently submitted my master's thesis which you can access <a href="thesisfinal.pdf">here</a>. It is an expositional description of operator product expansion algberas (and so VOAs), in the language of algebraic geometry, starting from the basics of jet theory in the easy-to-visualise case of smooth manifolds.</li>
                <li> Some compatriots and I run a Gromov-Witten theory reading group at the University of Melbourne which you can find <a href="https://sites.google.com/student.unimelb.edu.au/gw-theory/home">here</a> or alternatively the notes posted on this site.</li>
                <li> I was recently invited to attend the Australian math conference <a href="https://matrix-inst.org.au/">MATRIX</a> for the topic of '<a href="https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/events/tensor-categories-quantum-symmetries-and-mathematical-physics/">Tensor Categories, Quantum Symmetries, and Mathematical Physics</a>' where I was a student speaker on pseudo-tensor categories and chiral algebras.</li>
