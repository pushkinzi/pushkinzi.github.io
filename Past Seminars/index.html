        <p>
          At this moment these rarely will have TeXed notes to accompany them, as they are all blackboard talks, and are only here as a matter of record. I may re-TeX some in the future, however, and most topics are present in some way in my <a href="../notes/">notes</a>.

        <h3>Conference Seminars</h3>
        <ol style="list-style: none;">
          <li>November 2024: <b>Pseudo-Tensor Categories, Chiral Algebras and Vertex Algebras</b>
          <br>At the Australian invitational research conference <a href="https://matrix-inst.org.au/"><b>MATRIX</b></a> on <a href="https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/events/tensor-categories-quantum-symmetries-and-mathematical-physics/"><b>Tensor Categories, Quantum Symmetries, and Mathematical Physics</b></a>. 
          <br> Pseudo-tensor categories take a step away from the usual modus operandi in tensor category theory, in that they are without any tensors. Nonetheless they present a useful tool, in particular in categories most relevant to algebraic geometry. They have been used by Beilinson-Drinfeld to rigourously construct chiral algebras and their sister algebras - in fact they are designed to capture higher variants of (commutative, unital) algebras that standard tensor categories have. For example, the product of vertex algebras, not a commutative algebra operation in the usual sense, is captured by pseudo-tensor categories.  Indeed, they reduce to operads in certain cases. Vertex algebras can be realised as objects in a pseudo-category of sheaves in this way; their modules similarly sheaves with sufficient support. The tools of algebraic geometry can then be used to study the very interesting categories of modules of vertex algebras.

          Seminars at the University of Melbourne
        </h3>
        <ol style="list-style: none;">
          <li>November 2024: <b>Enumerations in GW-theory</b>
            <br> Gromov-Witten theory and quantum cohomology are intertwined. In particular, enumerations originating from GW-theory allow for some calculation of 'quantum invariants'. </li>
          <li>
            August 2024: <b>Braided Monoidal Categories and the Cobordism Categories</b>
            <br> Braidings of monoidal categories presents a rich structure that offers a variety of ares to study. Basic examples of monoidal categories admitting braidings include the braid category &#120121; of Joyal-Street, the category of vector spaces twisted by a 2-cocyle, and the cobordism categories. The latter offers a perspective to topological quantum field theories.
          </li>
          <li>
            May 2024: <b> The Global Torelli Theorem for K3 Surfaces</b>
            <br> Once one has the local Torelli theorem, one is able to construct the moduli space of K3 surfaces. More so, one has the knowledge of the number of connected components and other useful topological information. Such powerful information allows one to a surjective map from the moduli space to the possible Hodge structures of K3 surfaces that is injective up to choice of connected component and other data that does not change equivalence class of surfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            May 2024: <b> The Local Torelli Theorem for K3 Surfaces</b>
            <br> Classically, tori are equivalent to the lattice in &#8450; from which they arise as a quotient. Similarly, one can represent a K3 surface in terms of its cohomology's Hodge structure. However, the relation is more intricate - we can at most say a priori that 'small changes in Hodge structure' result in 'small change in K3 surface'.
          </li>
          <li>
            February 2024: <b>Elliptic Curves as Riemann Surfaces and as Groups</b>
            <br> A beautiful (and relatively quick!) story connects integral solutions of elliptic equations to complex Riemann surfaces using only elementary topology and complex analysis. Furthermore, the meromorphic functions on elliptic curves are simple to describe; they also can be used to give these curves (topological) group structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            September 2023: <b>Error Correcting Codes and Projective Geometry</b>
            <br> Error correcting codes are easy-to-define objects in linear algebra and information theory, but are deceptively useful and present primarily in Moonshine in which they are defining objects for certain interesting conformal field theories. The Gleason-Prange theorem is popular in information theory - it states that 'nice' codes are invariant under special conformal transformations. In fact these codes are deeply connected to projective geometry.
