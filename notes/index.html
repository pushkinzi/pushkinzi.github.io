    Here is where I keep notes of things that I have tried to understand, have understood, thought many might have difficulty understanding, or did not understand. Anything written below is intended to be factual and rigorous, though with a focus on where things come and how to think of them. These are part-and-parcel of course, but I find that the best way to learn things is to do them. Hence if you have come here to learn I would advise you simply practice whatever I write yourself - the valuable thing to me is to tell people how to think about things, so that they might be able to take concepts further. Mostly, these are for me to refer to when I forget them.

      If you find something below which is not factual, not rigorous, or even worse outright false, please contact me.
