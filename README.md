I'm Jakob, a junior mathematician. This github is primarily a storage device for my projects/notes/life/special interests.
I'm interested in things relating to the intersection of algebraic geometry and physics. It is ostensibly an odd combination, but to me there is a special type of beauty when the two are put together. 
At the very least it is a combination that I will never become bored with.

My favourite mathematicians historically are Alexander Grothendieck (of course) and Masaki Kashiwara. Contemporarily my favourites are those I know personally who work at the University of Melbourne and the Australian National University.

You can see what I do on my webpage here.

This account is named such because of my fanatisism for the wit of Alex Pushkin and teacher Zhuang.
